How to configure a PHT station?
Make sure hat Java is installed on configured. Then install gradale. Just follow these instructions:
i) sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
ii) sudo apt-get update
iii) sudo apt-get install gradle

Finally, see the gradle version using '$ gradle --version'

Step 1: You need to install gradle in at least version 4, since currently you need to build the application. But make sure Java is installed and configured. 

Step 2: You need to install the library : https://github.com/PersonalHealthTrain/library.git 
        locally, with: sudo gradle publishToMavenLocal
		
Step 3: You need to install the Docker Client Implementation that the station uses: https://github.com/PersonalHealthTrain/docker-client-implementation.git 		
        again using: gradle publishToMavenLocal
		
Step 4: You get the station application: https://github.com/PersonalHealthTrain/station.git
        Build it using: gradle build. Then 	Then there is gonna be a .jar file in build/libs which you have to run using: java -jar but before that see below
		
The station is programmed in such a way that it will fetch all the trains it has not executed yet and try to  process them. If a train fails, it will just be removed and retried

Further requirements: You need Docker and use docker login again to connect to the registry. Install the docker and do the following:

asif@ubuntu:~$ sudo docker login 193.196.20.88:3000

[sudo] password for asif: 
Username: rezacsedu
Password: 
Error response from daemon: Get https://193.196.20.88:3000/v1/users/: net/http: TLS handshake timeout	
	
$ sudo vim etc/docker/daemon.json
Add the following contents:
{                             
     "insecure-registries" : ["http://menzel.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:9191" ]
}
Then  sudo systemctl restart docker

The station needs to authenticate at two points independently, I plan to refactor this, but this is the current state
Login $ sudo docker login 193.196.20.88:9191
User: rezacsedu
Pass: rezapassword
